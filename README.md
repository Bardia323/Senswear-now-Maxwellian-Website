EXISTENCE
     And my soul would for the winged brooks
     Be enwrapped within its shade,
     While I wander, as I go, above
     The transient pleasures of this world;
     Yet these pleasures shall eternally
     Be mingled with the thought of thee
     And of Ligeia; and thus be they born
     In the soul-searching stars, which thou canst
     Not behold, nor describe, lest thou be tainted
     With the desire to know, and the terror
     Of the unknown.
     
 THE FALLEN HOTEL
      A melancholy sadness overshadows all. The walls are leaning. The
      carpentry is bleeding. The shutters are broken. The
      gondolas are half open. The lanterns are out—the metal
      clanging to and fro. The horses are split. The mules are
      frothing at the mouth. The pigs are in heat. The cats
      are snarling. The devils are shrieking. The angels are
      neighing. The wind is rushing—the sky is turning
      bloodshot—the stars are bleaching. All is wrong!

      And here, in the lonely ear, I beheld a strange sound,
         Out of the harmony of which man takes specious
      detail, there came rolling down from the high heavens
         A high-pitched shriek, a high-pitched shriek, a low, low,
         And the top of the sky was clothed with a vast and
      hideous fields of color, arouse in the earth, arouse in the
      earth, the sentient elements.
      
 THE MUSE
     Thou hast called me thy Muse,
     And secretly I love
     thee above all things;
     thy beauty and thy sadness
     are there in the rain
     like celestial Aphrodite.
